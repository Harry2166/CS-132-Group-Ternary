                                <h4>What is our project?</h4>
                                <p>The main tagline of senior high school was that students, after graduating, would be equipped with all of the necessary skills, and knowledge needed to survive in the real world and earn a decent living. DepEd claimed that graduates of the said program are “job ready” due to the choice of students being able to pick their career path in the form of different academic tracks <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1022415">(PNA, n.d.)</a>.</p>
                                <p>However, just less than a decade after its implementation, there has been a lot of debate as to whether or not it was an effective program or just a waste of 2 years that could have already been spent in college as well as the added burden to the already financially struggling average Filipino.</p>
                                <h5>Problem</h5>
                                <p>This study aims to determine if the K-12 system, highest educational attainment of the workers, and other related factors have a direct effect on the unemployment statistics in the Philippines.</p>
                                <h5>Solution</h5>
                                <p>The researchers will use data science on the collected data to gain insights regarding how the unemployment rate has evolved ever since the implementation of SHS in the Philippines’ education system and whether or not different factors contributed to it too.</p>

                                <h4>Background of our Study</h4>
                                <p>On May 15, 2013, the late President Benigno S. Aquino III signed into law: Republic Act No. 10533 - An Act Enhancing The Philippine Basic Education System By Strengthening Its Curriculum And Increasing The Number Of Years For Basic Education, Appropriating Funds Therefor And For Other Purposes. Section 4 states that The enhanced basic education program encompasses at least one (1) year of kindergarten education, six (6) years of elementary education, and six (6) years of secondary education, in that sequence. Secondary education includes four (4) years of junior high school and two (2) years of senior high school education <a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2013/05/15/republic-act-no-10533/">(Republic Act No. 10533, 2013)</a></p>
                                <p>This was one of the biggest changes in Philippine education as secondary education has, as far as anyone can remember, lasted only 4 years.</p>
                                <p>Fun fact: Before the change, the Philippines was only one of three countries implementing a 10 year pre-university cycle (basic education), with the other two being Angola and Djibouti.</p>
                                <p>Today, the DepEd is currently reviewing its curriculum, and a new curriculum pilot run is targeted to be done in 2025 <a href="https://mb.com.ph/2024/2/19/dep-ed-eyes-pilot-run-of-new-shs-curriculum-in-sy-2025-2026">(Manila Bulletin, 2024)</a>.</p>
                                <h5>Primary Research Question</h5>
                                <p>How has the implementation of SHS affected the unemployment rate in the Philippines?</p>
                                <h5>Secondary Research Question</h5>
                                <p>What are the factors that can affect the employment status of an individual?</p>
                                <h5>Alternative Hypothesis</h5>
                                <p>The implementation of SHS yielded a dip in the unemployment rate over the years.</p>
                                <h5>Null Hypothesis</h5>
                                <p>The implementation of SHS did not yield any difference in the unemployment rate over the years.</p>
                                <h5>Action Plan</h5>
                                <p>Analyze the data of the Labor Force Survey conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority from 2016 to 2023 specifically on unemployment.</p>

                                <h4>What were the Methods we used to Collect and Analyze our Data?</h4>
                                <h5>Data Preprocessing</h5>
                                <p>The microdata of the available datasets were downloaded from the PSA catalog website. As of the time of the data collection, the most recent available microdata was of March 2023. 
                                </br></br>The dataset used in the research was derived from the mentioned microdata by the following steps:
                                </br>1. After being downloaded, the microdata were then unzipped and each folder was placed in another folder. 
                                </br>2. The researchers then created a Python script (<a href="https://github.com/Harry2166/CS-132-Group-Ternary/blob/947b68ebac46f0b6fe5395f4d0bfe2e95f51d100/python_scripts/reduce-to-unemployed.py">found here</a>), and using the pandas module, added a year-surveynum column to each of the microdata, wherein year is the year of the survey and surveynum is the survey number of that year. 
                                </br>3. After adding that column, each .csv file was then filtered based on the Employment Status (Based on New Criteria on Unemployment) or the PUFNEWEMPSTAT, wherein if a sample had a “2” on the column, it indicated unemployment. As the column title of each .csv file was inconsistent, each differing column title was then renamed to “PUFNEWEMPSTAT,” and from there, filtered if they are equal to 2. 
                                </br>4. Once the dataset was filtered, they are then saved to a separate indiviual .csv files.
                                </br>5. After being separated to individual .csv files, they were then transferred to another folder, and the researchers created another Python script (<a href="https://github.com/Harry2166/CS-132-Group-Ternary/blob/main/python_scripts/reduce-unemployed-variables.py">found here</a>), and inserted in the unemployment rate of that given year and survey number and the associated grade number of their highest grade associated.
                                </br>6. Other columns were also renamed for the sake of consistency. The .csv files were then filtered down to the necessary variables using pandas and were saved to separate .csv files.
                                </br>7. The online tool <a href="https://extendsclass.com/merge-csv.html">Merge CSV files Online</a> was used to combine the .csv file
                                </br>8. The merged .csv file was then uploaded to GDrive.
                                </br>9. Because it cannot be opened properly in GSheets, the merged .csv file was then split using the online tool: <a href="https://www.splitcsv.com/">Split CSV</a> and each individual csv file was placed in its own GSheet.
                                </br>10. Using the pandas module in a google colab, the columns <i>PUFC26_WYNOT</i> and <i>PUFC38_PREVJOB</i> were removed using the del operation. 
                                </br>11. Each column was then renamed using a more understandable indicator of their name.
                                </br>12. Rows with empty values were then removed from the dataset.
                                </br>13. The dataset was then sorted based on the year-surveynum column
                                </br>14. The year-surveynum was then renamed to be based on quarters
                                </br>15. The subsequent unemployment rate was changed to correspond to the quarter's unemployment rate</p>
                                <h5>Data Collection</h5>
                                <p>The microdata of the Labor Force Surveys (LFS) dated January 2016 to March 2023 were collected from the <a href="https://psada.psa.gov.ph/catalog/LFS/about">central data catalog</a> of PSA. They were then processed under the procedure mentioned in the data preprocessing section. Data collection was done from the middle of March to the end of March 2024.

                                <p>For this study, the relevant data features are:</p>
                                <p>Region, Rural Classification, Relationship to Household Head, Sex, Age as of Last Birthday, Marital Status, Highest Grade Completed, Reason for not Looking for Work, Previous Occupation, Employment Status</p>
                                <p>They were mainly chosen due to their relationship with regards to the research question as important variables that may contribute to the unemployment status of an individual.</p>

                                  <h5>Primary Research Question</h5>
                                  <p>A line graph of the unemployment rate from quarter 1 of 2016 until quarter 1 of 2023 is shown. The outlier data from the COVID-19 pandemic was removed. They consisted of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. From this data, employed data and retired people's data were also removed from the plotting in order to mainly focus on the unemployed.</p>
                                  <iframe src="plots/unemployment_rate_over_years.html" height="800" width="1200" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
                                  <h5>Secondary Research Question</h5>
                                  <p>To determine what are the other factors that can affect the employment status, a violin plot and heat map were utilized. Only the most recent quarter (quarter 1 of 2023) was taken into account, as this represents the status of employment in the country that we have today. Unemployed data of legal working age were only taken into account in this visualization, ranging from ages 15 - 64. </p>
                                  <iframe src="plots/age_distribution.html" height="800" width="1200" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
                                  <p>Most employed persons are in the range of 20-50, the typical age for work. Majority of those who are not part of the labor force are at the youngest end of the spectrum. Finally, though might not be obvious, if we look closely (by hovering) at the unemployment rate per age it actually decreases as we go older starting at age 22-23 (the age of graduation).</p>

                                  <p>The plot shows how the highest education attainment relate with the number of people in employment status </p>

                                  <p>Most married and separated people are employed as expected . However, there are also a number of them who are not part of the labor force (possibly housewives / house husbands), we can also see the same observation to widows, though the frequency might be less. Single people also comprise most of those who are not part of the labor force (can be students).  In this survey, those whose marriages were annulled were either employed or not part of the workforce.</p>

                                  <p>From the plot we can see that, apart from the National Capital Region, most of the population still live in Rural Areas, regardless of employment status. What's worth noting is that there are a number of employed persons living in Urban Areas in ARMM. </p>

                                <h4>Hypothesis Testing</h4>
                                <p>An interrupted time series (ITS) was used in performing the hypothesis testing. 
                                  It is a statistical test that aims to examine the effect of an intervention (Ferron & Rendina-Gobioff, 2005) 
                                  within a population / group. An intervention is defined as a controlled external influence or set of influences 
                                  (Regis, 2022). To determine the effect of an intervention, the changes in level and slope of the time series and 
                                  the statistical significance of the intervention parameters are evaluated.</p>
                                <p>The hypothesis testing used two different models, <b>OLS</b> and <b>ARIMA</b>.</p>
                                <p>OLS is particularly good for simpler cases wherein there is no autocorrelation between data points. Whereas ARIMA is a more complicated model that is better for variables with autocorrelation.</p>
                                <h5>OLS</h5>
                                <p>In OLS, there are 4 key variables in a time series equation and it can be represented as:</p>

                                <h5>ARIMA</h5>
                                <p>In ARIMA, these are the key variables:</p>

                                <p>In this study, two interventions were chosen, the K-12 graduation of the first batch of SHS students and the 
                                  COVID-19 pandemic. As there was a sudden spike of unemployment during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it 
                                  was considered as outliers and the 4 quarters following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the 
                                  starting quarter, were removed from the analysis of the K-12 graduation intervention period. However, they 
                                  were retained for the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                                <p>A Durbin-Watson statistic score of 1.874 implies there is a close to negligible autocorrelation in the data. Hence, OLS can be used.</p>

It shows how far off the unemployment rate was from its predicted value (no lockdown). As over time and restrictions ease however, we can see the unemployment rate come closer to its predicted number. Nevertheless, the model estimates that the employment rate increased by 8.15%.
